# LSTM_Models_Comparison
So I've read this blog called "Understanding LSTM Networks" and based on that I've made a simple project that compares various types of RNNs Specifically LSTM Models 

The models that i've taken into consideration for this project are
- Vanilla LSTM
- GRU
- Bidrectional LSTM
- Coupled Input forget gate LSTM
- Peephole LSTM

The whole project is divided into 5 phases 
First the data processing is done, the data that i've taken is the binary ratings of imdb which I got from kaggle. 
Next the models are coded.
Then there's model training and fine tuning.
Moving on we compare the results of all 5 RNNs
Finally I'll Deploy this project.  

This is my first project which I'll be implementing from a research paper and I have 29 more projects to be deployed [maybe not 29]
considering each project is taken from Sutskewer's TOP 30 Papers/Blogs.

Currently I'm at the foundational stage of understanding deep learning by reading about CNNs,RNNs etc

Thank you for reading.
